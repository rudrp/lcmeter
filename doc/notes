[ theory of operation ]

first, the exact values of c_ref and l_ref are needed. they are assumed
to be unknown, even if some values are chosen at circuit build time. a
calibration phase is done. this phase aims at building a 2 equations 2
unknown system. to do so, 2 frequencies are measured. it is known that
the frequency of a LC circuit is determined by:
f = 1 / (2 * pi * sqrt(l * c))

a first frequency f_0 is measured with l_ref and c_ref
f_0 = 1 / (2 * pi * sqrt(l_ref * c_ref))

then, a second frequency f_1 is measured by putting a capacitor c_fixed
in parallel with c_ref. c_fixed is a high precision capacitor, whose
value is chosen to be 1000*10^-12 (1000pF):
f_1 = 1 / (2 * pi * sqrt(l_ref * (c_ref + 10^-12)))
note that the same could have been done with non coupled series inductors.
(so, why do all the circuits use parallel caps? are high quality inductor
less easy to find? less cheap? difficult to avoid magnetic coupling in
small circuits?)

thus, we have the following system:
{
f_0 = 1 / (2 * pi * sqrt(l_ref * c_ref))
f_1 = 1 / (2 * pi * sqrt(l_ref * (c_ref + 10^-12)))
}

solving (expriming c_ref in function of l_ref then substituting) gives:
{
c_ref = (f_1^2 / (f_0^2 - f_1^2)) * 10^-9;
l_ref = 1 / (4 * pi * c_ref * f_0^2);
}

[ calibration mode ]
when the calibration button is pressed, capacitor or inductor hardcoded
theoritical values are corrected. the lc sense switch is used to select
which one to calibrate. when calibrating inductance, the measurement
pins must be shorted. when calibrating for capacitance, they must be
floating.

use a one transistor oscillator
